This app basically shows a personal version of Vebto's popular music streaming script. It is intended as open source (except the actual PHP script) so additional features can be added by others. 

Users can easily add songs, artists and albums they like from any of the pages to their own library where they can manage and listen everywhere.

Johnson Music is the place to enjoy and expand your love of music. It’s where you listen to the track, artists, and albums all in one place. It’s also where you explore genres you never knew you’d love, and add new songs to your personal music library with endless listening experiences.

Johnson Music lets you play your music on whichever device you’re using – your iOS device, Mac, PC, or Android. Rock out on your way to work. Kick back and relax at home. Create playlists for your next party. Or let someone else be the DJ and listen to awesome tracks that are from different Countries. 
_More Web Apps for other OSs coming soon._
